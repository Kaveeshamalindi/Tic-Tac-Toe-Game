## 🎮 How to Play

- Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. 
- One player uses X and the other uses O. 
- Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square. 
- The goal is to get three of the same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. 
- If all squares are filled and no one has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
